# Pizza site
This project is example of how can may look like site of ordering pizza.
In this project I used laravel authentication module, so you can register your account and saw history of your orders.
If you doesn't wanna see prices in dollars, you can switch prices to euro. Project use "exchangeratesapi" to get real rates 
of converting dollars to euros.
